    <H1 style="color:rgb(12, 150, 70); font-size: 200%;">Responsive Design</h1> 


<p>It is an idea that changed the way we design for a multi-device web, and in this article, we'll help you understand the main techniques you need to know to master it.</p>


<p>At one point in history you had two options when designing a website:</p>

<ul>
 <li>You could create a <em>liquid</em> site, which would stretch to fill the browser window</li>
 <li>or a <em>fixed width</em> site, which would be a fixed size in pixels.</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/rwd/liquid-width.html"><strong>Simple Liquid Layout</strong></a></p>
<p>and</p>
<a href="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/rwd/fixed-width.html"><strong>Simple Fixed Width Layout</strong></a></p>

<div class="notebox">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: See this simple layouts and observe the result as you change the browser window size.</p>
</div>


<div class="notebox">
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: The screenshots above are taken&nbsp;using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Responsive_Design_Mode">Responsive Design Mode</a> in Firefox DevTools.</p>
    </div>
 

    <p>As the mobile web started to become a reality with the first feature phones, companies who wished to embrace mobile would generally create a special mobile version 
        of their site, with a different URL (often something like <em>m.example.com</em>, or <em>example.mobi</em>). This meant that two separate versions of the site had
         to be developed and kept up-to-date.</p>

    <p>In addition, these mobile sites often offered a very cut down experience. As mobile devices became more powerful and able to display full websites, this was
        frustrating to mobile users who found themselves trapped in the site's mobile version and unable to access information they knew was on the full-featured 
        desktop version of the site.</p>



<h1>Flexible layout before responsive design</h1>

<p>Zoe Mickley Gillenwater was instrumental in <a href="https://zomigi.com/blog/voices-that-matter-slides-available/">her work</a> to describe and formalize the 
    different ways in which flexible sites could be created, attempting to find a happy medium between filling the screen or being completely fixed in size.</p>


<h2>Responsive design</h2>

<p>The term responsive design was <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">coined by Ethan Marcotte in 2010</a>&nbsp;and described the use of 
    three techniques in combination.</p>

<ol>
 <li>The first was the idea of fluid grids, something which was already being explored by Gillenwater, and can be read up on in Marcotte's article, 
     <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/fluidgrids/">Fluid Grids</a> (published in 2009 on A List Apart).</li>
 <li>The second technique was the idea of <a href="https://unstoppablerobotninja.com/entry/fluid-images">fluid images</a>. Using a very simple technique of setting the 
    <code>max-width</code> property to <code>100%</code>, images would scale down smaller if their containing column became narrower than the image's intrinsic size, 
    but never grow larger. This enables an image to scale down to fit in a flexibly-sized column, rather than overflow it, but not grow larger and become pixelated 
    if the column becomes wider than the image.</li>
 <li>The third key component was the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries">media query</a>. Media Queries enable the type of layout 
    switch that Cameron Adams had previously explored using JavaScript, using only CSS. Rather than having one layout for all screen sizes, the layout could be changed. 
    Sidebars could be repositioned for the smaller screen, or alternate navigation could be displayed.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is important to understand that <strong>responsive web design isn't a separate technology</strong> — it is a term used to describe an approach to web design or a 
    set of best practices, used to create a layout that can <em>respond</em> to the device being used to view the content. In Marcotte's original exploration this meant 
    flexible grids (using floats) and media queries, however in the almost 10 years since that article was written, working responsively has become the default. Modern CSS
     layout methods are inherently responsive, and we have new things built into the web platform to make designing responsive sites easier.</p>

<p>The rest of this article will point you to the various web platform features you might want to use when creating a responsive site.</p>


<h2>Media Queries</h2>


<p>Responsive design was only able to emerge due to the media query. The Media Queries Level 3 specification became a Candidate Recommendation in 2009, meaning that it was 
    deemed ready for implementation in browsers. Media Queries allow us to run a series of tests (e.g. whether the user's screen is greater than a certain width, or a 
    certain resolution) and apply CSS selectively to style the page appropriately for the user's needs.</p>

<p>For example, the following media query tests to see if the current web page is being displayed as screen media (therefore not a printed document) and the viewport is at 
    least 800 pixels wide. The CSS for the <code>.container</code> selector will only be applied if these two things are true.</p>

    <p>    <img src="/images/medscreen.PNG" alt="grid" class="center">   </p>


    <p>You can add multiple media queries within a stylesheet, tweaking your whole layout or parts of it to best suit the various screen sizes. The points at which a 
        media query is introduced, and the layout changed, are known as <em>breakpoints</em>.</p>

    <p>A common approach when using Media Queries is to create a simple single-column layout for narrow-screen devices (e.g mobile phones), then check for larger 
        screens and implement a multiple-column layout when you know that you have enough screen width to handle it. This is often
        described as <strong>mobile first</strong> design.</p>
    
    <p>Find out more in the MDN documentation for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries">Media Queries</a>.</p>

<h2>Flexible grids</h2>

<p>Responsive sites don't just change their layout between breakpoints, they are built on flexible grids. A flexible grid means that you don't need to target every possible 
    device size that there is, and build a pixel perfect layout for it. That approach would be impossible given the vast number of differently-sized devices that exist,
     and the fact that on desktop at least, people do not always have their browser window maximized.</p>

<p>By using a flexible grid, you only need to add in a breakpoint and change the design at the point where the content starts to look bad. For example, if the line lengths 
    become unreadably long as the screen size increases, or a box becomes squashed with two words on each line as it narrows.</p>

<p>In the early days of responsive design, our only option for performing layout was to use
     <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Floats">floats</a>. Flexible floated layouts were achieved by giving each element a 
     percentage width, and ensuring that across the layout the totals were not more than 100%. In his original piece on fluid grids, Marcotte detailed a formula for 
     taking a layout designed using pixels and converting it into percentages.</p>


     <p>    <img src="/images/flexgrid.PNG" alt="grid" class="center">   </p>




<p>For example, if our target column size is 60 pixels, and the context (or container) it is in is 960 pixels, we divide 60 by 960 to get a value we can use in our 
         CSS, after moving the decimal point two places to the right.</p>



<p>    <img src="/images/flexgrid1.PNG" alt="grid" class="center">   </p>



<p>This approach will be found in many places across the web today, and it is documented here in the layout section of our
              <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Legacy_Layout_Methods">Legacy layout methods</a> article. It is likely that you will 
              come across websites using this approach in your work, so it is worth understanding it, even though you would not build a modern site using a 
              float-based flexible grid.</p>

<p>The following example demonstrates a simple responsive design using Media Queries and a flexible grid. On narrow screens the layout displays the boxes 
             stacked on top of one another:</p>


             <a href="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/rwd/float-based-rwd.html"><strong>Responsive !</strong></a></p>

<p>On wider screens they move to two columns!</p>

<h2>Modern layout technologies</h2>

<p>Modern layout methods such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Multiple-column_Layout">Multiple-column layout</a>, 
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox">Flexbox</a>, 
    and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids">Grid</a> are responsive by default. They all assume that you are trying to 
    create a flexible grid and give you easier ways to do so.</p>


<h2>Multicol</h2>
<p>The oldest of these layout methods is multicol — when you specify a <code>column-count</code>, this indicates how many columns you want your content 
    to be split into. The browser then works out the size of these, a size that will change according to the screen size.</p>
    <p>    <img src="/images/multicol222.PNG" alt="grid" class="center">   </p>

    <p>If you instead specify a column-width, you are specifying a minimum width. The browser will create as many columns of that width as will comfortably fit into 
        the container, then share out the remaining space between all the columns. Therefore the number of columns will change according to how much space there is.</p>

        <p>    <img src="/images//multicol223.PNG" alt="grid" class="center">   </p>

<h2>Flexbox</h2>
<p>In Flexbox, flex items will shrink and distribute space between the items according to the space in their container, as their initial behavior. By changing the 
    values for <code>flex-grow</code> and <code>flex-shrink</code> you can indicate how you want the items to behave when they encounter more or less space around them.</p>

<p>In the example below the flex items will each take an equal amount of space in the flex container, using the shorthand of <code>flex: 1</code> as described in the 
    layout topic <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox#flexible_sizing_of_flex_items">Flexbox: Flexible sizing of flex items</a>.</p>


    <p>    <img src="/images/flex4.PNG" alt="grid" class="center">   </p>

    <div class="notebox">
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: As an example, we have rebuilt the simple responsive layout above, this time using flexbox. You can see how we no longer need to use 
        strange percentage values to calculate the size of the columns: <a href="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/rwd/flex-based-rwd.html">example</a>, 
        <a href="https://github.com/mdn/css-examples/blob/master/learn/rwd/flex-based-rwd.html" class="external" rel=" noopener">source code</a>.</p>
    </div>


<h2>CSS grid</h2>
<p>In CSS Grid Layout the <code>fr</code> unit allows the distribution of available space across grid tracks. The next example creates a grid container with three 
    tracks sized at <code>1fr</code>. This will create three column tracks, each taking one part of the available space in the container.
     You can find out more about this approach to create a grid in the Learn Layout Grids topic, under
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids#flexible_grids_with_the_fr_unit">Flexible grids with the fr unit</a>.</p>

      <p>    <img src="/images/flexgrid2.PNG" alt="grid" class="center">   </p>



<div class="notebox">
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: The grid layout version is even simpler as we can define the columns on the .wrapper: 
        <a href="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/rwd/grid-based-rwd.html">example</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/mdn/css-examples/blob/master/learn/rwd/grid-based-rwd.html">source code</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Responsive images</h2>
<p>The simplest approach to responsive images was as described in Marcotte's early articles on responsive design. Basically, you would take an image that was at the 
    largest size that might be needed, and scale it down. This is still an approach used today, and in most stylesheets, you will find the following CSS somewhere:</p>
    
    <div class="codebox">
        <p>
        <pre>
        <code>
            

                img                &#123;
                    max-width: 100%;
                    &#125;
        
                  
        </code>
        </pre>
        </p>
        </div> 
         
        <p>There are obvious downsides to this approach. The image might be displayed a lot smaller than its intrinsic size, which is a waste of bandwidth — a 
            mobile user may be downloading an image several times the size of what they actually see in the browser window. In addition, you may not want the 
            same image aspect ratio on mobile as on desktop. For example, it might be nice to have a square image for mobile, but show the same scene as a 
            landscape image on desktop. Or, acknowledging the smaller size of an image on mobile you might want to show a different image altogether, one 
            which is more easily understood at a small screen size. These things can't be achieved by scaling down an image.</p>

        <p>Responsive Images, using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture"><code>&lt;picture&gt;</code></a> element and 
            the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img"><code>&lt;img&gt;</code></a> <code>srcset</code> and <code>sizes</code> attributes 
            solve both of these problems. You can provide multiple sizes along with "hints" (meta data that describes the screen size and resolution the image is
            best suited for), and the browser will choose the most appropriate image for each device, ensuring that a user will download an image size appropriate
             for the device they are using.</p>
        
        <p>You can also <em>art direct</em> images used at different sizes, thus providing a different crop or completely different image to different screen sizes.</p>
        
        <p>You can find a detailed <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images">guide to Responsive Images 
            in the Learn HTML section</a> here on MDN.</p>

<h2>Responsive typography</h2>

<p>An element of responsive design not covered in earlier work was the idea of responsive typography. Essentially, this describes changing font sizes within media
     queries to reflect lesser or greater amounts of screen real estate.</p>

<p>In this example, we want to set our level 1 heading to be <code>4rem</code>, meaning it will be four times our base font size. That's a really large heading! 
    We only want this jumbo heading on larger screen sizes, therefore we first create a smaller heading then use media queries to overwrite it with the larger 
    size if we know that the user has a screen size of at least <code>1200px</code>.</p>


    <p>    <img src="/images/resptyp.PNG" alt="grid" class="center">   </p>

    <p>We have edited our responsive grid example above to also include responsive type using the method outlined. You can see how the heading switches sizes as the layout 
        goes to the two column version.</p>

    <p>On mobile the heading is smaller:</p>



<div class="codebox">
    <strong>Note</strong>: See this example in action: <a href="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/rwd/type-rwd.html">example</a>, 
    <a href="https://github.com/mdn/css-examples/blob/master/learn/rwd/type-rwd.html" >source code</a>.
</div>

<p>On desktop, however, we see the larger heading size.</p>
<p>As this approach to typography shows, you do not need to restrict media queries to only changing the layout of the page. They can be used to tweak any element 
    to make it more usable or attractive at alternate screen sizes.</p>
