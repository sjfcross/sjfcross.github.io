    <H1 style="color:rgb(12, 150, 70); font-size: 200%;">Responsive Design</h1> 


<p>It is an idea that changed the way we design for a multi-device web, and in this article, we'll help you understand the main techniques you need to know to master it.</p>


<p>At one point in history you had two options when designing a website:</p>

<ul>
 <li>You could create a <em>liquid</em> site, which would stretch to fill the browser window</li>
 <li>or a <em>fixed width</em> site, which would be a fixed size in pixels.</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/rwd/liquid-width.html"><strong>Simple Liquid Layout</strong></a></p>
<p>and</p>
<a href="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/rwd/fixed-width.html"><strong>Simple Fixed Width Layout</strong></a></p>

<div class="notebox">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: See this simple layouts and observe the result as you change the browser window size.</p>
</div>


<div class="notebox">
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: The screenshots above are taken&nbsp;using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Responsive_Design_Mode">Responsive Design Mode</a> in Firefox DevTools.</p>
    </div>
 

    <p>As the mobile web started to become a reality with the first feature phones, companies who wished to embrace mobile would generally create a special mobile version 
        of their site, with a different URL (often something like <em>m.example.com</em>, or <em>example.mobi</em>). This meant that two separate versions of the site had
         to be developed and kept up-to-date.</p>

    <p>In addition, these mobile sites often offered a very cut down experience. As mobile devices became more powerful and able to display full websites, this was
        frustrating to mobile users who found themselves trapped in the site's mobile version and unable to access information they knew was on the full-featured 
        desktop version of the site.</p>



<h1>Flexible layout before responsive design</h1>

<p>Zoe Mickley Gillenwater was instrumental in <a href="https://zomigi.com/blog/voices-that-matter-slides-available/">her work</a> to describe and formalize the 
    different ways in which flexible sites could be created, attempting to find a happy medium between filling the screen or being completely fixed in size.</p>


<h2>Responsive design</h2>

><p>The term responsive design was <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">coined by Ethan Marcotte in 2010</a>&nbsp;and described the use of 
    three techniques in combination.</p>

<ol>
 <li>The first was the idea of fluid grids, something which was already being explored by Gillenwater, and can be read up on in Marcotte's article, 
     <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/fluidgrids/">Fluid Grids</a> (published in 2009 on A List Apart).</li>
 <li>The second technique was the idea of <a href="https://unstoppablerobotninja.com/entry/fluid-images">fluid images</a>. Using a very simple technique of setting the 
    <code>max-width</code> property to <code>100%</code>, images would scale down smaller if their containing column became narrower than the image's intrinsic size, 
    but never grow larger. This enables an image to scale down to fit in a flexibly-sized column, rather than overflow it, but not grow larger and become pixelated 
    if the column becomes wider than the image.</li>
 <li>The third key component was the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries">media query</a>. Media Queries enable the type of layout 
    switch that Cameron Adams had previously explored using JavaScript, using only CSS. Rather than having one layout for all screen sizes, the layout could be changed. 
    Sidebars could be repositioned for the smaller screen, or alternate navigation could be displayed.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is important to understand that <strong>responsive web design isn't a separate technology</strong> â€” it is a term used to describe an approach to web design or a 
    set of best practices, used to create a layout that can <em>respond</em> to the device being used to view the content. In Marcotte's original exploration this meant 
    flexible grids (using floats) and media queries, however in the almost 10 years since that article was written, working responsively has become the default. Modern CSS
     layout methods are inherently responsive, and we have new things built into the web platform to make designing responsive sites easier.</p>

<p>The rest of this article will point you to the various web platform features you might want to use when creating a responsive site.</p>
