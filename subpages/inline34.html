    <H1 style="color:rgb(12, 150, 70); font-size: 200%;">What went wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript</h1> 

        <h1>Types of error</h1>

        <p>Generally speaking, when you do something wrong in code, there are two main types of error that you'll come across:</p>

        <ul>
         <li><strong>Syntax errors</strong>: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through — you 
            will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error 
            messages mean!</li>
         <li><strong>Logic errors</strong>: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs 
            successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source 
            of the error.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Okay, so it's not quite <em>that</em> simple — there are some other differentiators as you drill down deeper. But the above classifications will do at this early 
            stage in your career. We'll look at both of these types going forward.</p>


    <h1>An erroneous example</h1>

<p>To get started, let's return to our number guessing game — except this time we'll be exploring a version that has some deliberate errors introduced.</p>


<h1><a href="/subpages/fontexa/number-game-errors.html">Here be buggy Dragons</a></h1>
   

<ol>
 <li>To get started, open the local copy inside your favorite text editor, and your browser.</li>
 <li>Try playing the game — you'll notice that when you press the "Submit guess" button, it doesn't work!</li>
</ol>

<p>At this point, let's consult the developer console to see if it reports any syntax errors, then try to fix them. You'll learn how below.</p>

<h2>Fixing syntax errors</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Go to the tab that you've got <code>number-game-errors.html</code> open in, and open your JavaScript console. You should see an error message along the following lines:
    
  <img alt="" src="/images/not-a-function.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" loading="lazy" width="700" height="583"></li>

  <li>This is a pretty easy error to track down, and the browser gives you several useful bits of information to help you out (the screenshot above is from Firefox, 
    but other browsers provide similar information). From left to right, we've got:

   <ul>
    <li>A red "x" to indicate that this is an error.</li>
    <li>An error message to indicate what's gone wrong: "TypeError: guessSubmit.addeventListener is not a function"</li>
    <li>A "Learn More" link that links through to an MDN page that explains what this error means in greater detail.</li>
    <li>The name of the JavaScript file, which links through to the Debugger tab of the developer tools. If you follow this link, you'll see the exact 
      line where the error is highlighted.</li>
    <li>The line number where the error is, and the character number in that line where the error is first seen. In this case, we've got line 86, character number 3.</li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If we look at line 86 in our code editor, we'll find this line:

    <img src="/images/numgame18.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center">      

  </li>
  <li>The error message says "guessSubmit.addeventListener is not a function", which means that the function we're calling is not recognized by the JavaScript interpreter. 
    Often, this error message actually means that we've spelled something wrong. If you are not sure of the correct spelling of a piece of syntax, it is often good to look 
    up the feature on MDN. The best way to do this currently is to search for "mdn <em>name-of-feature</em>" with your favorite search engine. Here's a shortcut to save 
    you some time in this instance: <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener">addEventListener()</a></code>.</li>
  <li>So, looking at this page, the error appears to be that we've spelled the function name wrong! Remember that JavaScript is case sensitive, so any slight difference 
    in spelling or casing will cause an error. Changing <code>addeventListener</code> to <code>addEventListener</code> should fix this. Do this now.</li>
