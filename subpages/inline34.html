    <H1 style="color:rgb(12, 150, 70); font-size: 200%;">What went wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript</h1> 

        <h1>Types of error</h1>

        <p>Generally speaking, when you do something wrong in code, there are two main types of error that you'll come across:</p>

        <ul>
         <li><strong>Syntax errors</strong>: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through — you 
            will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error 
            messages mean!</li>
         <li><strong>Logic errors</strong>: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs 
            successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source 
            of the error.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Okay, so it's not quite <em>that</em> simple — there are some other differentiators as you drill down deeper. But the above classifications will do at this early 
            stage in your career. We'll look at both of these types going forward.</p>


    <h1>An erroneous example</h1>

<p>To get started, let's return to our number guessing game — except this time we'll be exploring a version that has some deliberate errors introduced.</p>


<h1><a href="/subpages/fontexa/number-game-errors.html">Here be buggy Dragons</a></h1>
   

<ol>
 <li>To get started, open the local copy inside your favorite text editor, and your browser.</li>
 <li>Try playing the game — you'll notice that when you press the "Submit guess" button, it doesn't work!</li>
</ol>

<p>At this point, let's consult the developer console to see if it reports any syntax errors, then try to fix them. You'll learn how below.</p>

<h2>Fixing syntax errors</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Go to the tab that you've got <code>number-game-errors.html</code> open in, and open your JavaScript console. You should see an error message along the following lines:
    
  <img alt="" src="/images/not-a-function.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" loading="lazy" width="700" height="583"></li>

  <li>This is a pretty easy error to track down, and the browser gives you several useful bits of information to help you out (the screenshot above is from Firefox, 
    but other browsers provide similar information). From left to right, we've got:

   <ul>
    <li>A red "x" to indicate that this is an error.</li>
    <li>An error message to indicate what's gone wrong: "TypeError: guessSubmit.addeventListener is not a function"</li>
    <li>A "Learn More" link that links through to an MDN page that explains what this error means in greater detail.</li>
    <li>The name of the JavaScript file, which links through to the Debugger tab of the developer tools. If you follow this link, you'll see the exact 
      line where the error is highlighted.</li>
    <li>The line number where the error is, and the character number in that line where the error is first seen. In this case, we've got line 86, character number 3.</li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If we look at line 86 in our code editor, we'll find this line:

    <img src="/images/numgame18.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center">      

  </li>
  <li>The error message says "guessSubmit.addeventListener is not a function", which means that the function we're calling is not recognized by the JavaScript interpreter. 
    Often, this error message actually means that we've spelled something wrong. If you are not sure of the correct spelling of a piece of syntax, it is often good to look 
    up the feature on MDN. The best way to do this currently is to search for "mdn <em>name-of-feature</em>" with your favorite search engine. Here's a shortcut to save 
    you some time in this instance: <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener">addEventListener()</a></code>.</li>
  <li>So, looking at this page, the error appears to be that we've spelled the function name wrong! Remember that JavaScript is case sensitive, so any slight difference 
    in spelling or casing will cause an error. Changing <code>addeventListener</code> to <code>addEventListener</code> should fix this. Do this now.</li>
 </ol>


<h2>Syntax errors round two</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Save your page and refresh, and you should see the error has gone.</li>

  <li>Now if you try to enter a guess and press the Submit guess button, you'll see ... another error!

    <img src="/images/numgame19.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center">      



  <li>This time the error being reported is "TypeError: lowOrHi is null", on line 78.

   <div class="notebox"><strong>Note</strong>: <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Null">Null</a></code> is a special value that 
    means "nothing", or "no value". So <code>lowOrHi</code> has been declared and initialised, but not with any meaningful value — it has no type or value.</div>
 
   <div class="notebox"><strong>Note</strong>: This error didn't come up as soon as the page was loaded because this error occurred inside a function 
    (inside the <code>checkGuess() { ... }</code> block). As you'll learn in more detail in our 
    later <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Functions">functions article</a>, 
    code inside functions runs in a separate scope than code outside functions. In this case, the code was not run and the error was not thrown until 
    the <code>checkGuess()</code> function was run by line 86.</div>
  </li>

  <li>Have a look at line 78, and you'll see the following code:
   <div class="code-example"><pre class="brush: js notranslate"><code>lowOrHi<span class="token punctuation">.</span>textContent <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">'Last guess was too high!'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre><button aria-hidden="false" type="button" class="copy-icon"><span class="visually-hidden">Copy to Clipboard</span></button></div>
  </li>
  <li>This line is trying to set the <code>textContent</code> property of the <code>lowOrHi</code> constant to a text string, but it's not working because <code>lowOrHi</code> does not contain what it's supposed to. Let's see why this is — try searching for other instances of <code>lowOrHi</code> in the code. The earliest instance you'll find in the JavaScript is on line 48:
   <div class="code-example"><pre class="brush: js notranslate"><code><span class="token keyword">const</span> lowOrHi <span class="token operator">=</span> document<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">querySelector</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'lowOrHi'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre><button aria-hidden="false" type="button" class="copy-icon"><span class="visually-hidden">Copy to Clipboard</span></button></div>
  </li>
  <li>At this point we are trying to make the variable contain a reference to an element in the document's HTML. Let's check whether the value is <code>null</code> after this line has been run. Add the following code on line 49:
   <div class="code-example"><pre class="brush: js notranslate"><code>console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>lowOrHi<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre><button aria-hidden="false" type="button" class="copy-icon"><span class="visually-hidden">Copy to Clipboard</span></button></div>
 
   <div class="note notecard">
   <p><strong>Note</strong>: <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/log">console.log()</a></code> is a really useful debugging function that prints a value to the console. So it will print the value of <code>lowOrHi</code> to the console as soon as we have tried to set it in line 48.</p>
   </div>
  </li>
  <li>Save and refresh, and you should now see the <code>console.log()</code> result in your console. <img alt="" src="/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_went_wrong/console-log-output.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" loading="lazy" width="700" height="583"> Sure enough, <code>lowOrHi</code>'s value is <code>null</code> at this point, so there is definitely a problem with line 48.</li>
  <li>Let's think about what the problem could be. Line 48 is using a <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector">document.querySelector()</a></code> method to get a reference to an element by selecting it with a CSS selector. Looking further up our file, we can find the paragraph in question:
   <div class="code-example"><pre class="brush: js notranslate"><code><span class="token operator">&lt;</span>p <span class="token keyword">class</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"lowOrHi"</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token operator">/</span>p<span class="token operator">&gt;</span></code></pre><button aria-hidden="false" type="button" class="copy-icon"><span class="visually-hidden">Copy to Clipboard</span></button></div>
  </li>
  <li>So we need a class selector here, which begins with a dot (<code>.</code>), but the selector being passed into the <code>querySelector()</code> method in line 48 has no dot. This could be the problem! Try changing <code>lowOrHi</code> to <code>.lowOrHi</code> in line 48.</li>
  <li>Try saving and refreshing again, and your <code>console.log()</code> statement should return the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element we want. Phew! Another error fixed! You can delete your <code>console.log()</code> line now, or keep it to reference later on — your choice.</li>
