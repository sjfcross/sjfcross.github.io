    <p>Let's imagine your boss has given you the following brief for creating this game:</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p>I want you to create a simple guess the number type game. It should choose a random number between 1 and 100, then challenge the player to guess the number in 10 turns. 
        After each turn the player should be told if they are right or wrong, and if they are wrong, whether the guess was too low or too high. It should also tell the player
         what numbers they previously guessed. The game will end once the player guesses correctly, or once they run out of turns. When the game ends, the player should be 
         given an option to start playing again.</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>Upon looking at this brief, the first thing we can do is to start breaking it down into simple actionable tasks, in as much of a programmer mindset as possible:</p>
    
    <ol>
     <li>Generate a random number between 1 and 100.</li>
     <li>Record the turn number the player is on. Start it on 1.</li>
     <li>Provide the player with a way to guess what the number is.</li>
     <li>Once a guess has been submitted first record it somewhere so the user can see their previous guesses.</li>
     <li>Next, check whether it is the correct number.</li>
     <li>If it is correct:
      <ol>
       <li>Display congratulations message.</li>
       <li>Stop the player from being able to enter more guesses (this would mess the game up).</li>
       <li>Display control allowing the player to restart the game.</li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li>If it is wrong and the player has turns left:
      <ol>
       <li>Tell the player they are wrong and whether their guess was too high or too low.</li>
       <li>Allow them to enter another guess.</li>
       <li>Increment the turn number by 1.</li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li>If it is wrong and the player has no turns left:
      <ol>
       <li>Tell the player it is game over.</li>
       <li>Stop the player from being able to enter more guesses (this would mess the game up).</li>
       <li>Display control allowing the player to restart the game.</li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li>Once the game restarts, make sure the game logic and UI are completely reset, then go back to step 1.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Let's now move forward, looking at how we can turn these steps into code, building up the example, and exploring JavaScript features as we go.</p>


    <h1><a href="/subpages/fontexa/number-guessing-game-start.html">Here be Dragons</a></h1>

    <h2>Adding variables to store our data</h2>

    <p>Let's get started. First of all, add the following lines inside your "script" element: </p>

    <img src="/images/numgame1.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center">  
    
    <p>This section of the code sets up the variables and constants we need to store the data our program will use. Variables are basically containers for values 
        (such as numbers, or strings of text). You create a variable with the keyword <code>let</code> (or <code>var</code>) followed by a name for your variable
         (you'll read more about the difference between the keywords in a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Variables#the_difference_between_var_and_let">future 
            article</a>). Constants are used to store values that are immutable or can't be changed&nbsp;and are created with the keyword <code>const</code>. 
            In this case, we are using constants to store references to parts of our user interface; the text inside some of them might change, but the HTML elements 
            referenced stay the same.</p>

<p>You can assign a value to your variable or constant with an equals sign (<code>=</code>) followed by the value you want to give it.</p>

<p>In our example:</p>

<ul>
 <li>The first variable — <code>randomNumber</code> — is assigned a random number between 1 and 100, calculated using a mathematical algorithm.</li>
 <li>The first three constants are each made to store a reference to the results paragraphs in our HTML, and are used to insert values into the paragraphs later on in the code 
     (note how they are inside a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element, which is itself used to select all three later on for resetting, when we restart the game):
     <img src="/images/numgame2.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center">  </li>

<li>The next two constants store references to the form text input and submit button and are used to control submitting the guess later on.

    <img src="/images/numgame3.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center">  </li>

<li>Our final two variables store a guess count of 1 (used to keep track of how many guesses the player has had), and a reference to a reset button that doesn't 
    exist yet (but will later).</li>


    <h2>Functions</h2>

    <p>Next, add the following below your previous JavaScript:</p>

    <img src="/images/numgame4.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center">  </li>


    <p>Functions are reusable blocks of code that you can write once and run again and again, saving the need to keep repeating code all the time. This is really useful. 
        There are a number of ways to define functions, but for now we'll concentrate on one simple type. Here we have defined a function by using the 
        keyword <code>function</code>, followed by a name, with parentheses put after it. After that we put two curly braces (<code>{ }</code>). Inside the curly 
        braces goes all the code that we want to run whenever we call the function.</p>

    <p>When we want to run the code, we type the name of the function followed by the parentheses.</p>
    
    <p>Let's try that now. Save your code and refresh the page in your browser. 
        Then go into the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools">developer tools JavaScript console</a>, 
        and enter the following line:</p>

        <img src="/images/numgame5.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center">  </li>

        <p>After pressing&nbsp;<kbd>Return</kbd>/<kbd>Enter</kbd>, you should see an alert come up that says <code>I am a placeholder</code>; 
            we have defined a function in our code that creates an alert whenever we call it.</p>

<h2>Operaters</h2>

<p>JavaScript operators allow us to perform tests, do math, join strings together, and other such things.</p>

<p>If you haven't already done so, save your code, refresh the page in your browser, and open 
    the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools">developer tools JavaScript console</a>. 
    Then we can try typing in the examples shown below — type in each one from the "Example" columns exactly as shown, 
    pressing <kbd>Return</kbd>/<kbd>Enter</kbd> after each one, and see what results they return.</p>

<p>First let's look at arithmetic operators, for example:</p>
<div class="center">
<table class="standard-table center">
    <thead>
     <tr>
      <th scope="col">Operator</th>
      <th scope="col">Name</th>
      <th scope="col">Example</th>
     </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
     <tr>
      <td><code>+</code></td>
      <td>Addition</td>
      <td><code>6 + 9</code></td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td><code>-</code></td>
      <td>Subtraction</td>
      <td><code>20 - 15</code></td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
      <td>Multiplication</td>
      <td><code>3 * 7</code></td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td><code>/</code></td>
      <td>Division</td>
      <td><code>10 / 5</code></td>
     </tr>
    </tbody>
   </table>
</div>


<p>You can also use the <code>+</code> operator to join text strings together (in programming, this is called <em>concatenation</em>).
     Try entering the following lines, one at a time:</p>

     <img src="/images/numgame6.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center"> 
     
<p>There are also some shortcut operators available, called augmented 
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators#assignment_operators">assignment operators</a>. 
    For example, if you want to add a new text string to an existing one and return the result, you could do this:</p>

      <img src="/images/numgame7.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center">  
      
<p>When we are running true/false tests (for example inside conditionals) 
    we use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators">comparison operators</a>. For example:</p>

    <img src="/images/numgame8.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center">     
    
    
    <h2>Conditionals</h2>

    <p>Returning to our <code>checkGuess()</code> function, I think it's safe to say that we don't want it to just spit out a placeholder message. We want it to 
        check whether a player's guess is correct or not, and respond appropriately.</p>

    <p>At this point, replace your current <code>checkGuess()</code> function with this version instead:</p>

    <img src="/images/numgame9.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center">      

    <p>This is a lot of code — phew! Let's go through each section and explain what it does.</p>

    <ul>
     <li>The first line (line 2 above) declares a variable called <code>userGuess</code> and sets its value to the current value entered inside the text field. 
      We also run this value through the built-in <code>Number()</code> constructor, just to make sure the value is definitely a number.</li>

     <li>Next, we encounter our first conditional code block (lines 3–5 above). A conditional code block allows you to run code selectively, depending on whether a 
       certain condition is true or not. It looks a bit like a function, but it isn't. The simplest form of conditional block starts with the keyword <code>if</code>,
       then some parentheses, then some curly braces. Inside the parentheses we include a test. If the test returns <code>true</code>, we run the code inside the curly
        braces. If not, we don't, and move on to the next bit of code. In this case the test is testing whether the <code>guessCount</code> variable is equal to <code>1</code> 
        (i.e. whether this is the player's first go or not):

    <img src="/images/numgame10.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center">  

      If it is, we make the guesses paragraph's text content equal to <code>Previous guesses: </code>. If not, we don't.</li>

      <li>Line 6 appends the current <code>userGuess</code> value onto the end of the <code>guesses</code> paragraph, plus a blank space so there will be a space between 
        each guess shown.</li>
      <li>The next block (lines 8–24 above) does a few checks:
       <ul>
        <li>The first <code>if(){ }</code> checks whether the user's guess is equal to the <code>randomNumber</code> set at the top of our JavaScript. If it is, the player 
          has guessed correctly and the game is won, so we show the player a congratulations message with a nice green color, clear the contents of the Low/High guess 
          information box, and run a function called <code>setGameOver()</code>, which we'll discuss later.</li>
        <li>Now we've chained another test onto the end of the last one using an <code>else if(){ }</code> structure. This one checks whether this turn is the user's last turn.
           If it is, the program does the same thing as in the previous block, except with a game over message instead of a congratulations message.</li>
        <li>The final block chained onto the end of this code (the <code>else { }</code>) contains code that is only run if neither of the other two tests 
          returns true (i.e. the player didn't guess right, but they have more guesses left). In this case we tell them they are wrong, then we perform another 
          conditional test to check whether the guess was higher or lower than the answer, displaying a further message as appropriate to tell them higher or lower.</li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The last three lines in the function (lines 26–28 above) get us ready for the next guess to be submitted. We add 1 to the <code>guessCount</code> variable so the player uses up their turn (<code>++</code> is an incrementation operation — increment by 1), and empty the value out of the form text field and focus it again, ready for the next guess to be entered.</li>
     </ul>

<h2>Events</h2>

    <p>At this point we have a nicely implemented <code>checkGuess()</code> function, but it won't do anything because we haven't called it yet. 
      Ideally we want to call it when the "Submit guess" button is pressed, and to do this we need to use an <strong>event</strong>. 
      Events are things that happen in the browser — a button being clicked, a page loading, a video playing, etc. — in response to which we can run blocks of code.
       The constructs that listen out for the event happening are called <strong>event listeners</strong>, and the blocks of code that run in response to the event
       firing are called <strong>event handlers</strong>.</p>

      <p>Add the following line below your <code>checkGuess()</code> function:</p>

      <img src="/images/numgame11.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center">  

      <p>Here we are adding an event listener to the <code>guessSubmit</code> button. This is a method that takes two input values (called <em>arguments</em>) — the type of event 
        we are listening out for (in this case <code>click</code>) as a string, and the code we want to run when the event occurs 
        (in this case the <code>checkGuess()</code> function). Note that we don't need to specify the parentheses when writing it 
        inside <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener" title="addEventListener()"><code>addEventListener()</code></a>.</p>

      <p>Try saving and refreshing your code now, and your example should work — to a point. The only problem now is that if you guess the correct answer or run out of guesses,
         the game will break because we've not yet defined the <code>setGameOver()</code> function that is supposed to be run once the game is over. Let's add our missing 
         code now and complete the example functionality.</p>

<h2>Finishing the game functionality</h2>

<p>Let's add that <code>setGameOver()</code> function to the bottom of our code and then walk through it. Add this now, below the rest of your JavaScript:</p>


<img src="/images/numgame12.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center">  


<ul>
  <li>The first two lines disable the form text input and button by setting their disabled properties to <code>true</code>. This is necessary, because if we didn't, the user could submit more guesses after the game is over, which would mess things up.</li>
  <li>The next three lines generate a new <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button"><code>&lt;button&gt;</code></a> element, set its text label to "Start new game", and add it to the bottom of our existing HTML.</li>
  <li>The final line sets an event listener on our new button so that when it is clicked, a function called <code>resetGame()</code> is run.</li>
 </ul>
 
 <p>Now we need to define this function too! Add the following code, again to the bottom of your JavaScript:</p>
