    <p>Let's imagine your boss has given you the following brief for creating this game:</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p>I want you to create a simple guess the number type game. It should choose a random number between 1 and 100, then challenge the player to guess the number in 10 turns. 
        After each turn the player should be told if they are right or wrong, and if they are wrong, whether the guess was too low or too high. It should also tell the player
         what numbers they previously guessed. The game will end once the player guesses correctly, or once they run out of turns. When the game ends, the player should be 
         given an option to start playing again.</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>Upon looking at this brief, the first thing we can do is to start breaking it down into simple actionable tasks, in as much of a programmer mindset as possible:</p>
    
    <ol>
     <li>Generate a random number between 1 and 100.</li>
     <li>Record the turn number the player is on. Start it on 1.</li>
     <li>Provide the player with a way to guess what the number is.</li>
     <li>Once a guess has been submitted first record it somewhere so the user can see their previous guesses.</li>
     <li>Next, check whether it is the correct number.</li>
     <li>If it is correct:
      <ol>
       <li>Display congratulations message.</li>
       <li>Stop the player from being able to enter more guesses (this would mess the game up).</li>
       <li>Display control allowing the player to restart the game.</li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li>If it is wrong and the player has turns left:
      <ol>
       <li>Tell the player they are wrong and whether their guess was too high or too low.</li>
       <li>Allow them to enter another guess.</li>
       <li>Increment the turn number by 1.</li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li>If it is wrong and the player has no turns left:
      <ol>
       <li>Tell the player it is game over.</li>
       <li>Stop the player from being able to enter more guesses (this would mess the game up).</li>
       <li>Display control allowing the player to restart the game.</li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li>Once the game restarts, make sure the game logic and UI are completely reset, then go back to step 1.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Let's now move forward, looking at how we can turn these steps into code, building up the example, and exploring JavaScript features as we go.</p>

    <h2>Adding variables to store our data</h2>

    <p>Let's get started. First of all, add the following lines inside your "script" element: </p>

    <img src="/images/numgame1.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center">  
    
    <p>This section of the code sets up the variables and constants we need to store the data our program will use. Variables are basically containers for values 
        (such as numbers, or strings of text). You create a variable with the keyword <code>let</code> (or <code>var</code>) followed by a name for your variable
         (you'll read more about the difference between the keywords in a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Variables#the_difference_between_var_and_let">future 
            article</a>). Constants are used to store values that are immutable or can't be changed&nbsp;and are created with the keyword <code>const</code>. 
            In this case, we are using constants to store references to parts of our user interface; the text inside some of them might change, but the HTML elements 
            referenced stay the same.</p>

<p>You can assign a value to your variable or constant with an equals sign (<code>=</code>) followed by the value you want to give it.</p>

<p>In our example:</p>

<ul>
 <li>The first variable — <code>randomNumber</code> — is assigned a random number between 1 and 100, calculated using a mathematical algorithm.</li>
 <li>The first three constants are each made to store a reference to the results paragraphs in our HTML, and are used to insert values into the paragraphs later on in the code 
     (note how they are inside a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element, which is itself used to select all three later on for resetting, when we restart the game):
     <img src="/images/numgame1.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center">  </li>

<li>The next two constants store references to the form text input and submit button and are used to control submitting the guess later on.

    <img src="/images/numgame2.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center">  </li>

<li>Our final two variables store a guess count of 1 (used to keep track of how many guesses the player has had), and a reference to a reset button that doesn't 
    exist yet (but will later).</li>
