    <H1 style="color:rgb(12, 150, 70); font-size: 200%;">Storing the information you need — Variables</h1> 

    <p class="summary">After reading the last couple of articles you should now know what JavaScript is, what it can do for you, how you use it alongside other web 
        technologies, and what its main features look like from a high level. In this article, we will get down to the real basics, looking at how to work 
        with the most basic building blocks of JavaScript — Variables.</p>


<h1>What is a variable?</h1>

<p>A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of a sentence. Let's look at a simple example:</p>

<img src="/images/variables1.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center">  


<p>In this example pressing the button runs some code. The first line pops a box up on the screen that asks the reader to enter their name, 
  and then stores the value in a variable. The second line displays a welcome message that includes their name, taken from the variable 
  value and the third line displays that name on the page.</p>

<p>To understand why this is so useful, let's think about how we'd write this example without using a variable. It would end up looking something like this:</p>


<img src="/images/variables2.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center">  

<p>You may not fully understand the syntax we are using (yet!), but you should be able to get the idea. If we didn't have variables available, 
  we'd have to ask the reader for their name every time we needed to use it!</p>

<p>Variables just make sense, and as you learn more about JavaScript they will start to become second nature.</p>

<p>One special thing about variables is that they can contain just about anything — not just strings and numbers. 
  Variables can also contain complex data and even entire functions to do amazing things. You'll learn more about this as you go along.</p>
  <div class="notebox">
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: We say variables contain values. This is an important distinction to make. Variables aren't the values themselves; they are containers
     for values. You can think of them being like little cardboard boxes that you can store things in.</p>
    </div>

    <img src="/images/boxes.png" alt="Malinka" class="center">  


    <h2>Declaring a variable</h2>

    <p>To use a variable, you've first got to create it — more accurately, we call this declaring the variable. To do this, 
      we type the keyword <code>var</code> or <code>let</code> followed by the name you want to call your variable:</p>

      <img src="/images/var1.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center">  

      <p>Here we're creating two variables called <code>myName</code> and <code>myAge</code>. Try typing these lines into your web browser's console. 
        After that, try creating a variable (or two) with your own name choices.</p>

        <div class="notebox">
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: In JavaScript, all code instructions should end with a semi-colon (<code>;</code>) — your code may work correctly for single lines, 
          but probably won't when you are writing multiple lines of code together. Try to get into the habit of including it.</p>
        </div>


        <p>You can test whether these values now exist in the execution environment by typing just the variable's name, e.g.</p>

        <img src="/images/var2.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center">  

        <div class="notebox">
          
          <p><strong>Note</strong>: Don't confuse a variable that exists but has no defined value with a variable that doesn't exist at all — they are very different things.
           In the box analogy&nbsp;you saw above, not existing would mean there's no box (variable) for a value&nbsp;to go in. No value defined would mean that there IS a box, 
           but it has no value inside it.</p>
        </div>

<h2>Initializing a variable</h2>

<p>Once you've declared a variable, you can initialize it with a value. You do this by typing the variable name, followed by an equals sign (<code>=</code>), followed by the 
  value you want to give it. For example:</p>

<img src="/images/var3.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center">  

<p>Try going back to the console now and typing in these lines. You should see the value you've assigned to the variable returned in the console to confirm it, 
  in each case. Again, you can return your variable values by typing their name into the console — try these again:</p>

  <img src="/images/var2.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center"> 

  <p>You can declare and initialize a variable at the same time, like this:</p>

  
<img src="/images/var4.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center">  


<p>This is probably what you'll do most of the time, as it is quicker than doing the two actions on two separate lines.</p>


<h2>The difference between var and let</h2>

<p>At this point you may be thinking "why do we need two keywords for defining variables?? Why have <code>var</code> <em>and</em> <code>let</code>?".</p>

<p>The reasons are somewhat historical. Back when JavaScript was first created, there was only <code>var</code>. This works basically fine in most cases, but it has 
  some issues in the way it works — its design can sometimes be confusing or downright annoying. So,&nbsp;<code>let</code> was created in modern versions of JavaScript, 
  a new keyword for creating variables that works somewhat differently to <code>var</code>, fixing its issues in the process.</p>

<p>A couple of simple differences are explained below. We won't go into all the differences now, but you'll start to discover them as you learn more about JavaScript 
  (if you really want to read about them now, feel free to check out our <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let">let reference
     page</a>).</p>

<p>For a start, if you write a multiline JavaScript program that declares and initializes a variable, you can actually declare a variable with <code>var</code> after you 
  initialize it and it will still work. For example:</p>



<img src="/images/var5.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center">  


  <div class="notebox">
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: This won't work when typing individual lines into a JavaScript console, just when running multiple lines of JavaScript in a web document.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This works because of <strong>hoisting</strong> — read <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var#var_hoisting">var
     hoisting</a> for more detail on the subject.</p>

  <p>Hoisting no longer works with <code>let</code>. If we changed <code>var</code> to <code>let</code> in the above example, it would fail with an error. 
    This is a good thing — declaring a variable after you initialize it results in confusing, harder to understand code.</p>
  
  <p>Secondly, when you use <code>var</code>, you can declare the same variable as many times as you like, but with <code>let</code> you can't. 
    The following would work:</p>

    <img src="/images/var6.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center">

    <p>But the following would throw an error on the second line:</p>

    <img src="/images/var7.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center">

    





    <p>Again, this is a sensible language decision. There is no reason to redeclare variables — it just makes things more confusing.</p>


    <p>For these reasons and more, we recommend that you use <code>let</code> as much as possible in your code, rather than <code>var</code>. 
      There is no reason to use <code>var</code>, unless you need to support old versions of Internet Explorer with your code (it doesn't support <code>let</code> until version
       11; the modern Microsoft Edge browser supports <code>let</code> just fine).</p>


<h2>Variable types</h2>

<h3>Numbers</h3>

<p>You can store numbers in variables, either&nbsp;whole numbers like 30 (also called integers) or decimal numbers like 2.456 (also called floats or floating point numbers). 
  You don't need to declare variable types in JavaScript, unlike some other programming languages. When you give a variable a number value, you don't include quotes:</p>

  <code><span class="token keyword">let</span> myAge <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">17</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code>

  <h3>Strings</h3>

  <p>Strings are pieces of text. When you give a variable a string value, you need to wrap it in single or double quote marks; otherwise, JavaScript tries to interpret it as another variable name.</p>

  <code><span class="token keyword">let</span> dolphinGoodbye <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">'So long and thanks for all the fish'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code>
  
  
  <h3>Booleans</h3>

  <p>Booleans are true/false values — they can have two values, <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. These are generally used to test a condition, after which code is run as appropriate. So for example, a simple case would be:</p>
  <code><span class="token keyword">let</span> iAmAlive <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token boolean">true</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code>
  <p>Whereas in reality it would be used more like this:</p>
  <code><span class="token keyword">let</span> test <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">6</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span> <span class="token number">3</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code>
  <p>This is using the "less than" operator (<code>&lt;</code>) to test whether 6 is less than 3. As you might expect, it returns <code>false</code>, because 6 is not
     less than 3! You will learn a lot more about such operators later on in the course.</p>

  <h3>Arrays</h3>

  <p>An array is a single object that contains multiple values enclosed in square brackets and separated by commas. Try entering the following lines into your console:</p>

  <code><span class="token keyword">let</span> myNameArray <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token string">'Chris'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">'Bob'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">'Jim'</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token keyword">let</span> myNumberArray <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token number">10</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">15</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">40</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code>

    <p>Once these arrays are defined, you can access each value by their location within the array. Try these lines:</p>

    <code>myNameArray<span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token number">0</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span> <span class="token comment">// should return 'Chris'</span>
      myNumberArray<span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token number">2</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span> <span class="token comment">// should return 40</span></code>

      <p>The square brackets specify&nbsp;an index value corresponding to the position of the value you want returned. You might have noticed that arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed: the first element is at index 0.</p>

<p>You'll learn a lot more about arrays in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Arrays">a future article</a>.</p>

<h3>Objects</h3>

<p>In programming, an object is a structure of code that models a real-life object. You can have a simple object that represents a box and contains information about its width, 
  length, and height, or you could have an object that represents a person, and contains data about their name, height, weight, what language they speak, how to say hello 
  to them, and more.</p>

<p>Try entering the following line into your console:</p>

<img src="/images/var9.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center">

<p>To retrieve the information stored in the object, you can use the following syntax:</p>

<img src="/images/var10.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center">


<p>We won't be looking at objects any more for now — you can learn more about those in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects">a future module</a>.</p>




<h3>Dynamic typing</h3>


<p>JavaScript is a "dynamically typed language", which means that, unlike some other languages, you don't need to specify what data type a variable will contain 
  (numbers, strings, arrays, etc).</p>

<p>For example, if you declare a variable and give it a value enclosed in quotes, the browser treats the variable as a string:</p>


<img src="/images/var11.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center">

<p>Even if the value contains numbers, it is still a string, so be careful:</p>

<img src="/images/var12.PNG" alt="Malinka" class="center">


<p>Try entering the four lines above into your console one by one, and see what the results are. You'll notice that we are using a special operator 
  called <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof">typeof</a></code> — this returns the data type of the variable you type after it. 
  The first time it is called, it should return <code>string</code>, as at that point the <code>myNumber</code> variable contains a string, <code>'500'</code>.&nbsp;Have 
  a look and see what it returns the second time you call it.</p>
