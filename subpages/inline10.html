<H2>Responsive Images</H2>

<p>Images need to  work well on devices with widely differing screen sizes, resolutions, and other such features </p>
<article>
<p>
<section>
  An improvement would be to display a cropped version of the image which displays the important details of
  the image when the site is viewed on a narrow screen. A second cropped image could be displayed for a medium 
  width screen device, like a tablet. This is commonly known as the <strong>art direction problem</strong>.

<section>
  In addition, there is no need to embed such large images on the page if it is being viewed on a mobile screen. 
  And conversely, a small raster image starts to look grainy when displayed larger than its original size 
  (a raster image is a set number of pixels wide and a set number of pixels tall, as we saw when we looked 
  at vector graphics). This is called the <strong>resolution switching problem</strong>.

<H3>Resolution switching - Diff Sizes</H3>

<strong>
<p>
<pre>
  &lt;img srcset="elva-fairy-480w.jpg 480w,
                elva-fairy-800w.jpg 800w"
sizes="(max-width: 600px) 480px,
 800px"
src="elva-fairy-800w.jpg"
alt="Elva dressed as a fairy"&gt;
</pre>
</p>
</strong>
<p>
<li>An image filename (elva-fairy-480w.jpg)</li>
<li>A space</li>
<li>The image's intrinsic width in pixels (480w) — note that this uses the w unit, <br>
  not px as you might expect. This is the image's real size, which can be found 
  by inspecting the image file.</li>
</p>
<p><strong>sizes</strong> defines a set of media conditions (e.g. screen widths) and indicates what image size 
  would be best to choose, when certain media conditions are true. 
<br>In this case, before each comma we write:</p>
<p>
<li>A media condition ((max-width:600px)) — you'll learn more about these in the CSS topic, but for now let's just say that <strong> a media condition describes a possible state that the screen can be in.</strong> In this case, we are saying "when the viewport width is 600 pixels or less".
<li>A space</li>
<li>The width of the slot the image will fill when the media condition is true (480px)</li>
</p>
<p>So, with these attributes in place, the browser will:
<ol>
  <li>Look at its device width.</li>
<li>Work out which media condition in the sizes list is the first one to be true.</li>
<li>Look at the slot size given to that media query.</li>
<li>Load the image referenced in the srcset list that has the same size as the slot or, if there isn't one, the first image that is bigger than the chosen slot size.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>And that's it! At this point, if a supporting browser with a viewport width of 480px loads the page, the (max-width: 600px) media condition will be true, and so the browser chooses the 480px slot. The elva-fairy-480w.jpg will be loaded, as its inherent width (480w) is closest to the slot size.</p>

<H3>Resolution switching - Same Size - Diff Resolutions</H3>

<p>If you're supporting multiple display resolutions, but everyone sees your image at the same real-world size on the screen, you can allow the browser to choose an appropriate resolution image by using srcset with x-descriptors and without sizes — a somewhat easier syntax! </p>

<strong>
  <p>
  <pre>
<img srcset="elva-fairy-320w.jpg,
             elva-fairy-480w.jpg 1.5x,
             elva-fairy-640w.jpg 2x"
     src="elva-fairy-640w.jpg"
     alt="Elva dressed as a fairy">

    </pre>
  </p>
  </strong>

  <p>In this example, the following CSS is applied to the image so that it will have a width of 320 pixels on the screen (also called CSS pixels):</p>

  <strong>
    <p>
    <pre>
      
      img {
        width: 320px;
      }

    </pre>
  </p>
  </strong>
