<H1 style="color:rgb(12, 150, 70); font-size: 200%;">Positioning</h1> 

<p>Positioning allows you to take elements out of the normal document layout flow, and make them behave differently; for example sitting on top of one another, or always 
    remaining in the same place inside the browser viewport. This article explains the different
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position"><code>position</code></a> values, and how to use them.</p>

  <h1>Introducing positioning</h1>
  
  <p>The whole idea of positioning is to allow us to override the basic document flow behavior described above, to produce interesting effects. What if you want to slightly 
    alter the position of some boxes inside a layout from their default layout flow position, to give a slightly quirky, distressed feel? Positioning is your tool. Or if you 
    want to create a UI element that floats over the top of other parts of the page, and/or always sits in the same place inside the browser window no matter how much the page 
    is scrolled? Positioning makes such layout work possible.</p>

    <p>There are a number of different types of positioning that you can put into effect on HTML elements. To make a specific type of positioning active on an element, 
      we use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position"><code>position</code></a> property.</p>


<p>We work on <a href="/subpages/fontexa/0_basic-flow.html"><strong>this file</strong></a></p>

<h2>Static positioning</h2>

<p>Static positioning is the default that every element gets — it just means "put the element into its normal position in the document layout flow — nothing special 
  to see here."</p>

<p>To demonstrate this, and get your example set up for future sections, first add a <code>class</code> of <code>positioned</code> to the 
  second <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p"><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></a> in the HTML:</p>



  <div class="codebox">
    <p>
    <pre>
    <code>
      &lt;p class="positioned"&gt; ... &lt;/p&gt;
    </code>
    </pre>
    </p>
    </div> 

    <p>Now add the following rule to the bottom of your CSS:</p>

    <div class="codebox">
      <p>
      <pre>
      <code>
        .positioned &#123;
          position: static;
          background: yellow;
          &#125;
      </code>
      </pre>
      </p>
      </div> 
  
      <p>If you now save and refresh, you'll see no difference&nbsp;at all, except for the updated background color of the 2nd paragraph. This is fine — as we said before,
        static positioning is the default behavior!</p>

    <h2>Relative positioning</h2>

    <p>Relative positioning is the first position type we'll take a look at. This is very similar to static positioning, except that once the positioned element has 
      taken its place in the normal layout flow, you can then modify its final position, including making it overlap other elements on the page. Go ahead and 
      update the <code>position</code> declaration in your code:</p>

      <div class="codebox">
        <p>
        <pre>
        <code>
          position: relative;
        </code>
        </pre>
        </p>
        </div> 

        <p>If you save and refresh at this stage, you won't see a change in the result at all.&nbsp; So how do you modify the element's position? You need to use 
          the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/top"><code>top</code></a>, 
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/bottom"><code>bottom</code></a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/left"><code>left</code></a>, and
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/right"><code>right</code></a> properties, which we'll explain in the next section.</p>

<h2>Introducing top, bottom, left, and right</h2>

<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/top"><code>top</code></a>, 
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/bottom"><code>bottom</code></a>, 
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/left"><code>left</code></a>, and 
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/right"><code>right</code></a> are 
  used alongside <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position"><code>position</code></a> 
  to specify exactly where to move the positioned element to. To try this out, add the following declarations to the <code>.positioned</code> rule in your CSS:</p>

  <div class="codebox">
    <p>
    <pre>
    <code>
      top: 30px;
      left: 30px;
    </code>
    </pre>
    </p>
    </div> 

    <div class="notebox">
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: The values of these properties can take any <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units">units
      </a> you'd logically expect — pixels, mm, rems, %, etc.</p>
    </div>


<p>    <img src="/images/relpos.PNG" alt="grid" class="center">   </p>



    <p>Cool, huh? Ok, so this probably wasn't what you were expecting — why has it moved to the bottom and right if we specified top and left? Illogical as it
      may initially sound, this is just the way that relative positioning works — you need to think of an invisible force that pushes the specified side of the 
      positioned box, moving it in the opposite direction. So for example, if you specify <code>top: 30px;</code>, a force pushes the top of the box, causing 
      it to move downwards by 30px.</p>

<h2>Absolute positioning</h2>

<p>Absolute positioning brings very different results. Let's try changing the position declaration in your code as follows:</p>

<div class="codebox">
  <p>
  <pre>
  <code>
    position: absolute;
  </code>
  </pre>
  </p>
  </div> 

  <p>If you now save and refresh, you should see something like so:</p>  

  <p>    <img src="/images/relpos1.PNG" alt="grid" class="center">   </p>


<p>First of all, note that the gap where the positioned element should be in the document flow is no longer there — the first and third elements have closed together like 
  it no longer exists! Well, in a way, this is true. An absolutely positioned element no longer exists in the normal document layout flow. Instead, it sits on its own 
  layer separate from everything else. This is very useful: it means that we can create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on 
  the page.&nbsp; For example, popup information boxes and control menus; rollover panels; UI features that can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the page; and so on...</p>

<p>Second, notice that the position of the element has changed — this is because <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/top"><code>top</code></a>, 
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/bottom"><code>bottom</code></a>,
   <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/left"><code>left</code></a>, and 
   <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/right"><code>right</code></a> behave in a different way with absolute positioning. Rather than positioning 
   the element based on its relative position within the normal document layout flow, they specify the distance the element should be from each of the containing 
   element's&nbsp;sides. So in this case, we are saying that the absolutely positioned element should sit 30px from the top of the "containing element", and 30px from the left.
    (In this case, the "containing element" is the&nbsp;<strong>initial containing block</strong>. See the section below for more information)</p>

    <div class="notebox">
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: You can use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/top"><code>top</code></a>, 
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/bottom"><code>bottom</code></a>, 
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/left"><code>left</code></a>, and 
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/right"><code>right</code></a> to resize elements if you need to. Try setting <code>top: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0; 
          right: 0;</code> and <code>margin: 0;</code> on your positioned elements and see what happens! Put it back again afterwards...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="notebox">
      <p><strong>Note</strong>:&nbsp;Yes, margins still affect positioned elements. Margin collapsing doesn't, however.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="notebox">
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: You can see the example at this point live at 
        <code><a href="https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/css/css-layout/positioning/3_absolute-positioning.html">3_absolute-positioning.html</a></code> 
        (<a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/css/css-layout/positioning/3_absolute-positioning.html" >see source code</a>).</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Positioning contexts</h2>

<p>Which element is the "containing element" of an absolutely positioned element? This is very much dependent on the position&nbsp;property of the ancestors of the positioned 
  element (See&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Containing_block#identifying_the_containing_block">Identifying the containing 
  block</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>If no ancestor elements have their&nbsp;position property explicitly defined, then by default&nbsp;all ancestor elements&nbsp;will have a static position. 
  The result of this is, the absolutely positioned element will be contained in the <strong>initial containing block</strong>. The initial containing block&nbsp;has the 
  dimensions of the viewport, and&nbsp;is also the block that contains the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html"><code>&lt;html&gt;</code></a> element. 
  In other words, the absolutely positioned element will be displayed outside of the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html"><code>&lt;html&gt;</code></a> 
  element, and be positioned relative to the initial viewport.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The positioned element is nested inside the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body"><code>&lt;body&gt;</code></a> in the HTML source, 
  but in the final layout, it is 30px away from the top and left of the edge of the page.&nbsp;We can change the <strong>positioning context</strong> — which element the 
  absolutely positioned element is positioned relative to. This is done by setting positioning on one of the element's&nbsp;ancestors — to one of the elements it is nested 
  inside (you can't position it relative to an element it is not nested inside). To demonstrate this, add the following declaration to your <code>body</code> rule:</p>

  <div class="codebox">
    <p>
    <pre>
    <code>
      position: relative;
    </code>
    </pre>
    </p>
    </div> 

    <p>This should give the following result:</p>

    <p>    <img src="/images/relpos2.PNG" alt="grid" class="center">   </p>


    <p>The positioned element now sits relative to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body"><code>&lt;body&gt;</code></a> element.</p>


<h2>Introducing z-index</h2>

<p>All this absolute positioning is good fun, but there is another thing we haven't considered yet — when elements start to overlap, what determines which elements appear
   on top of which other elements? In the example we've seen so far, we only have one positioned element in the positioning context, and it appears on the top, 
   since positioned elements win over non-positioned elements. What about when we have more than one?</p>

<p>Try adding the following to your CSS, to make the first paragraph absolutely positioned too:</p>

<div class="codebox">
  <p>
  <pre>
  <code>
    p:nth-of-type(1) &#123;
      position: absolute;
      background: lime;
      top: 10px;
      right: 30px;
      &#125;
  </code>
  </pre>
  </p>
  </div> 

  <p>    <img src="/images/relpos3.PNG" alt="grid" class="center">   </p>


  <p>At this point you'll see the first paragraph colored lime, moved out of the document flow, and positioned a bit above from where it originally was. 
    It is also stacked below the original <code>.positioned</code> paragraph, where the two overlap. This is because the <code>.positioned</code> paragraph 
    is the second paragraph in the source order, and positioned elements later in the source order win over positioned elements earlier in the source order.</p>

  <p>Can you change the stacking order? Yes, you can, by using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index"><code>z-index</code></a> property. "z-index" 
    is a reference to the z-axis. You may recall from previous points in the course where we discussed web pages using horizontal (x-axis) and vertical 
    (y-axis) coordinates to work out positioning for things like background images and drop shadow offsets. (0,0) is at the top left of the page (or element),
    and the x- and y-axes run across to the right and down the page (for left to right languages, anyway.)</p>
  
  <p>Web pages also have a z-axis: an imaginary line that runs from the surface of your screen, towards your face (or whatever else you like to have in front of the screen). 
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index"><code>z-index</code></a> values affect where positioned elements sit on that axis; 
    positive values move them higher up the stack, and negative values move them lower down the stack. By default, positioned elements all have a <code>z-index</code> of 
    <code>auto</code>, which is effectively 0.</p>
  
  <p>To change the stacking order, try adding the following declaration to your <code>p:nth-of-type(1)</code> rule:</p>

  <div class="codebox">
    <p>
    <pre>
    <code>
      z-index: 1;
    </code>
    </pre>
    </p>
    </div> 

    <p>You should now see the finished example, with the lime paragraph on top:</p>

    <p>    <img src="/images/relpos4.PNG" alt="grid" class="center">   </p>

    <p>Note that <code>z-index</code> only accepts unitless index values; you can't specify that you want one element to be 23 pixels up the Z-axis — it doesn't 
      work like that. Higher values will go above lower values, and it is up to you what values you use. Using 2 and 3 would give the same effect as 300 and 40000.</p>


<h1>Fixed positioning</h1>

<p>Let's now look at fixed positioning. This works in exactly the same way as absolute&nbsp;positioning, with one key difference: whereas absolute positioning fixes an 
  element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one),<strong> fixed positioning</strong> <em>usually</em> 
  fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport, except if one of its ancestors is a fixed containing block due to its 
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform">transform property</a> being different from none. This means that you can create useful UI 
  items that are fixed in place, like persisting navigation menus that are always visible no matter how much the page scrolls.</p>

<p>Let's put together a simple example to show what we mean. First of all, delete the existing <code>p:nth-of-type(1)</code> and <code>.positioned</code> rules from 
  your CSS.</p>

<p>Now, update the <code>body</code> rule to remove the <code>position: relative;</code> declaration and add a fixed height, like so:</p>

<div class="codebox">
  <p>
  <pre>
  <code>
    body &#123;
      width: 500px;
      height: 1400px;
      margin: 0 auto;
      &#125;
  </code>
  </pre>
  </p>
  </div> 

  <p>Now we're going to give the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code></a> element <code>position: fixed;</code>, and get it to sit at the top of the viewport.
     Add the following rule to your CSS:</p>


     <div class="codebox">
      <p>
      <pre>
      <code>
         
        h1 &#123;
          position: fixed;
          top: 0;
          width: 500px;
          margin-top: 0;
          background: white;
          padding: 10px;
          &#125;

      </code>
      </pre>
      </p>
      </div> 


      <p>The <code>top: 0;</code> is required to make it stick to the top of the screen. We give the heading the same width as the content column and then give it a white 
        background and some padding and margin, so the content won't be visible underneath it.</p>

      <p>If you save and refresh now, you'll see a fun little effect whereby the heading stays fixed, and the content appears to scroll up and disappear underneath it. 
        But we could improve this more — at the moment some of the content starts off underneath the heading. This is because the positioned heading no longer appears 
        in the document flow, so the rest of the content moves up to the top. We need to move it all down a bit; we can do this by setting some top margin on the first
         paragraph. Add this now:</p>
