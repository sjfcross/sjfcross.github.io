    <H2 style="color:rgb(12, 150, 70);">Sizing items in CSS</h2>

    <p>In the various lessons so far you have come across a number of ways to size items on a web page using CSS. Understanding how big the different features 
        in your design will be is important, and in this lesson we will summarize the various ways elements get a size via CSS and define a few terms around sizing 
        that will help you in the future.
    </p>


    <p>An empty &lt;div&gt;, on the other hand, has no size of its own. If you add a &lt;div&gt; to your HTML with no content, then give it a border, you will see a line on the page. This is the collapsed border on the element — there is no content to hold it open. In our example below, that border 
         stretches to the width of the container, because it is a block level element, a behavior that should be starting to become familiar to you. It has no height 
         (or size in the block dimension) because there is no content.
    </p>

    <div class="box">
    </div>

<h3>  Using percentages</h3>

<p>In many ways, percentages act like length units, and as we discussed in the lesson on values and units, 
    they can often be used interchangeably with lengths. When using a percentage you need to be aware what it is a percentage of. 
    In the case of a box inside another container, if you give the child box a percentage width it will be a percentage of the width of the parent container. As on the upper "box" with a width of 50%.
</p>

<h3>Percentage margins and padding</h3>

<p>If you set margins and padding as a percentage, you may notice some strange behavior.
     In the below example we have a box. We have given the inner box a margin of 10% and a padding of 10%. The padding and margin on the top and bottom 
     of the box are the same size as the margin on the left and right.
</p>
<div class="box2">
    I have margin and padding set to 10% on all sides.
  </div>
<p>
  You might expect for example the percentage top and bottom margins to be a percentage of the element's height, and the percentage left and right margins to be a percentage 
  of the element's width. However, this is not the case!
</p>
<p>When you use margin and padding set in percentages, the value is calculated from the inline size of the containing block — therefore the width when working
     in a horizontal language. In our example, all of the margins and padding are 10% of the width. 
     This means you can have equal-sized margins and padding all around the box. This is a fact worth remembering if you do use percentages in this way.    
</p>

<h3>min- and max- sizes</h3>

<p>In addition to giving things a fixed size, we can ask CSS to give an element a minimum or a maximum size.
    If you have a box that might contain a variable amount of content, and you always want it to be at least a certain height, you could set the min-height property on it. 
    The box will always be at least this height, but will then grow taller if there is more content than the box has space for at its minimum height.
</p>
<p>
In the example below you can see two boxes, both with a defined height of 70 pixels. 
The box on the top is 70 pixels tall; the box on the right has content that needs more room, and so it has grown taller than 70 pixels.
</p>

<div class="wrapper">
    <div class="box3"></div>
    <div class="box3">These boxes both have a min-height set, this box has content in it which will need more space than the assigned height, and so it grows from the minimum.</div>
  </div>

  <h4>This is very useful for dealing with variable amounts of content while avoiding overflow.</h4>

 <p>A common use of max-width is to cause images to scale down if there is not enough space to display them at their intrinsic width while making sure they don't 
     become larger than that width.
</p>
<p>
  As an example, if you were to set width: 100% on an image, and its intrinsic width was smaller than its container, the image would be forced to stretch and
  become larger, causing it to look pixelated.
</p>
<p>
  If you instead use max-width: 100%, and its intrinsic width was greater than its container, the image is able to become smaller than its container size, 
  and will stop at 100% of its container size.
</p>
<p>
  In the example below, we have used the same image three times. The first image has been given<strong> width: 100% </strong>and is in a container which is larger than it,
   therefore it stretches to the container width. The second image has <strong>max-width: 100% </strong>set on it and therefore does not stretch to fill the container. 
   The third box contains the same image again, also with <strong>max-width: 100% </strong>set; in this case you can see how it has scaled down to fit into the box.
</p>

<div class="wrapper">
    <div class="box4"><img src="/images/star.png" alt="star" class="width"></div>
    <div class="box4"><img src="/images/star.png" alt="star" class="max"></div>
    <div class="minibox"><img src="/images/star.png" alt="star" class="max"></div>
  </div>
      
  <h3>Viewport units</h3>

  <p>The viewport — which is the visible area of your page in the browser you are using to view a site — also has a size. 
      In CSS we have units which relate to the size of the viewport — the vw unit for viewport width, and vh for viewport height. 
      Using these units you can size something relative to the viewport of the user.
</p>
<p>
  1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport height, and 1vw is equal to 1% of the viewport width. 
  You can use these units to size boxes, but also text. In the example below we have a box which is sized as 20vh and 20vw. 
  The box contains a letter A, which has been given a font-size of 10vh.
</p>

<div class="box5">
    A
  </div>

  <p>Sizing things according to the viewport can be useful in your designs. For example, if you want a full-page hero section to show before the rest of your content, 
      making that part of your page 100vh high will push the rest of the content below the viewport, meaning that it will only appear once the document is scrolled.
