      This simple dish of beautifully seasoned chicken and peas is the meal solution you’re looking for when you’re short on time but want something tasty and healthy!
      
      I just love this quick meal. It looks like there’s not much to it but looks are deceiving. This has so much flavor even with minimal ingredients.
      
      Peas don’t get enough credit. I feel like a lot of us grew up with bad experiences with this particular legume. They were overcooked, mushy, and bland. Boy, when peas aren’t cooked correctly they are no good, friend. Let’s not do that.
      
      When peas are cooked properly and seasoned well they are such a perfect addition to any meal.</p>
